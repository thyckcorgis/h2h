# Heart 2 Heart Confessations

## Inspiration
Originating from 4 am Discord calls, hundreds of thought provoking messages, and an everlasting "I'm glad we had this conversation", we aspire to extend this feeling to others who are experiencing the negative effects of isolation.

## What it does
Our app promotes health communication between friends, family, and more by tackling the anxiety that comes with initiating a confessation, a difficult but meaningful conversation.

**Features**
- Filter conversation topics by: "Happy", "Heavy", "To the speaker", and "Self-Reflection".
- Add custom cards anonymously at the beginning of each game.
- Free open-ended rules: We provide the foundation, you control the conversation.

## How we built it
We used React Native for cross-platform mobile development. Next, we used Socket.io for real time two-way communication with an Express back end.

## Challenges we ran into
- Fonts
- Differences between expo and bare React Native workflow
- NPM dependency hell
- JavaScript shenanigans: the difference between working code and crashing was usually 1 to 2 characters

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to bring a personal experience that strongly bonded us into an app that can be shared with others. Two thirds of the team do not come from a software development background so being able to develop a presentable product in time was a major feat.

## What we learned
This was our first hackathon (for two thirds of us anyways) and sleep was definitely an important factor we missed. Playing up each team member's strengths was vital to finishing the project. ```console.log()``` is the best debugging tool xd

## What's next for Heart 2 Heart
Creating more confessation cards, topics, and maybe building a web version of the app. A long term goal would be implementing a video/voice call function within the app itself.
